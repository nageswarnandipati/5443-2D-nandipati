# Space Fight!

## Venkata Nageswar Reddy Nandipati, Thivya Tanneedi

## Description:

This is a two-player game created using the Pygame library in Python. The game window has a width of 900 pixels and a height of 500 pixels. The game involves two spaceships, one controlled by the red player and one by the green player. These spaceships can be controlled by the players to move in four directions - up, down, left, and right. The objective of the game is to shoot the opponent until its health reaches zero. The health values are dynamically updated during the game. The game includes sound effects for bullet hits and bullet fires, which are loaded from external audio files. The health of each spaceship is displayed on the screen. The game is played on a background image of space. The game ends when one of the spaceships runs out of health, and the winner is declared on the screen for 5 seconds before the game restarts.  

The game runs at a frame rate of 60 frames per second (FPS) and defines the velocity (VEL) of the spaceships as 5 pixels per frame. The velocity of bullets (BULLET_VEL) is set to 7 pixels per frame, and the maximum number of bullets allowed on the screen (MAX_BULLETS) is set to 3.
