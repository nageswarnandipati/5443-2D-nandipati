### Description:
This code is an implementation of the classic game Tetris using Pygame, a popular Python library for game development. Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game where players manipulate falling blocks to create complete rows, which are then cleared from the game board.


The code starts by importing the required libraries, pygame and random. Pygame is a library for writing video games in Python, and random is used to generate random numbers for various game features.
- Make sure you install library pygame using `pip install pygame`

    - `python main.py`
    
Class MySprite, which inherits from pygame.sprite.Sprite. This class represents the main character sprite in the game and loads a series of images to be used as animation frames for the character's walking animation.

Block class represents the individual blocks that make up the Tetris game pieces. This class has properties like x and y coordinates, block types, colors, and rotations. It also has methods to initialize the block, get the current Tetris block, rotate the block, and check for collisions with other blocks on the game field.
